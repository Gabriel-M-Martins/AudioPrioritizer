# AudioPrioritizer

A rather simple script that let you choose, from a list of processes on your pc, a process to prioritize the audio over others. Inspired by https://gist.github.com/sverrirs/d099b34b7f72bb4fb386 and a personal need to turn down the games volume when listening to something like youtube or whatever I'm currently listening lol.
